### Hello there 👋
~~*general Kenobi*~~

*I am Twenty aka. TwentyFourMinutes, I do a lot of code.*

Almost always my code in written in C#, as its my favourite language. The back-end is where you can find me, since JavaScript is my worst nightmare. Usually most of the stuff I do is open-source and using the latest features the .NET Team throws at us. Most of the things I do are all about raw speed and Developer experience which are the key points of all the projects I do.

If you want to know more about me and what I do, either check out my pinned repositories or my [website](https://twenty-four.dev).
